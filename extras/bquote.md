Macro Substitution in R
================

This note is a *very* cursory overview of some macro-substitution facilities available in [`R`](https://www.r-project.org). We are going to try to put a few of them in context (there are likely more we are missing) and explain why we wrote yet another one ([`wrapr::let()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wrapr/vignettes/let.html)).

The `R` macro facilities we will discuss include (in time order):

-   `defmacro()` [Lumley T. "Programmer's Niche: Macros in R", R News, 2001, Vol 1, No. 3, pp 11â€“13](https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf).
-   `base::bquote()` ([released in R 1.8.1, November 2003](https://github.com/wch/r-source/blob/5a156a0865362bb8381dcd69ac335f5174a4f60c/doc/NEWS.1)).
-   `gtools::defmacro()` ([gtools 2.0.9, September 2, 2005](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/gtools/)) from the [`gtools`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gtools) package.
-   `strmacro()` ([gtools 2.1.1, September 23, 2005](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/gtools/)) from the [`gtools`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gtools) package.
-   `lazyeval` package ([released October 1, 2014](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/lazyeval/)).
-   `wrapr::let()` ([announced/released December 8th, 2016](https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr/blob/master/extras/wrapr_let.pdf)).
-   `rlang::!!` ([released May 5th, 2017](https://cran.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/rlang/)).

Why macros and metaprogramming
------------------------------

Many `R` users never need any of `R`'s macro or metaprogramming capabilities. That is because the core language and packages are designed such that such capabilities are not immediately necessary.

For example. A common way to extract a column from a `data.frame` is to use the "`$`" operator:

``` r
d <- data.frame(x = 1:2, y = 3:4)
d$y
```

    ## [1] 3 4

In the above the name "`y`" is captured from the source-code. For another program to use this notation we might need a macro facility to substitute in a name coming form another variable. However, `R` supplies the `[[]]` notation which is a value-oriented interface, meaning we do not need to resort to macros.

``` r
COLUMNNAME <- "y"
d[[COLUMNNAME]]
```

    ## [1] 3 4

However, not all `R` functions and packages have this discipline of design. In particular some commands such as `base::order()` can be hard to program over (due to its heavy leaning on the "`...`" argument unlike the [`data.table`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) design of having both a `data.table::setorder()` and a `data.table::setorderv()`).

So roughly in `R` macros and meta-programming are not urgent user-facing problems, until the user attempts to program over an interface that *only* is designed for interactive use (i.e., doesn't accept or have an alternative that accepts values stored in additional variables).

Macros are a bit technical, but when you are painted into a programming corner: you want macros. So let's talk more about macros and metaprogramming.

### Technial defintions

In computer science a macro is "a rule or pattern that specifies how a certain input sequence (often a sequence of characters) should be mapped to a replacement output sequence (also often a sequence of characters) according to a defined procedure" ([source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science))). Macros are most interesting when the input they are working over is program source code (either parsed or not-parsed). Metaprogramming "Metaprogramming is a programming technique in which computer programs have the ability to treat programs as their data" ([source Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)).

The two concepts are related. Each has variations. For example <code>C</code>-macros are very strict text substitutions performed by a pre-processor in some of the code compilation stages. Whereas <code>Lisp</code> macros are a more powerful beast operating on <code>Lisp</code> data structures and language objects.

Very roughly both concepts are "code that writes code."

Macros and metaprogramming in `R`
---------------------------------

### `defmacro()`/`gtools::defmacro()`

`defmacro()` was introduced to the `R` community by [a fantastic article by Thomas Lumley in 2001](https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf), and then later enhanced and distributed as part of the [`gtools` package](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=gtools) by Gregory R. Warnes. The purpose of macros are to produce "code that writes new code" and thus lessons programmer effort.

This can be made clear with an example. Macros superficially look a bit like functions: the encapsulate some code. However, instead of running code in an isolated environment (the function evaluation environment) they instead perform as if the user had type the code directly. Let's jump ahead in our timeline and use `gtools::defmacro()` (now by Thomas Lumley and enhanced by Gregory R. Warnes) to define a macro called "`set_variable`" as follows.

``` r
library("gtools")

set_variable <- defmacro(VARNAME, VARVALUE, 
                         expr = { VARNAME <- VARVALUE })
```

And using such a macro is easy.

``` r
set_variable(x, 7)
print(x)
```

    ## [1] 7

Notice that a function can interact with the global environment without using escape systems such as `<<-` or direct manipulations of environments. The macro's lack of isolation is both its benefit (it works as if the user had typed the code in the macro) and detriment (in many many cases you should prefer the safe isolation of functions).

I strongly suggest reading [the article](https://www.r-project.org/doc/Rnews/Rnews_2001-3.pdf), as it shares a great deal of wisdom and humor. I can't resist stealing a bit of the conclusion from the article.

> While defmacro() has many (ok, one or two) practical uses, its main purpose is to show off the powers of substitute(). Manipulating expressions directly with substitute() can often let you avoid messing around with pasting and parsing strings, assigning into strange places with &lt;&lt;- or using other functions too evil to mention.

We couldn't use `defmacro()` for our application (programming of `dplyr 0.5.0`) as the `substitute` will not substitute the left-hand sides of argument bindings (which is how `dplyr::mutate()` specifies assignment).

``` r
substitute(list(A = A), list(A = "x"))
```

    ## list(A = "x")

``` r
defmacro(A, expr = list(A = A))("x")
```

    ## $A
    ## [1] "x"

The unwillingness of `substitute()` to replace left-hand sides of argument bindings is likely intentional. For standard function arguments (those that are not "`...`") such as the `x` in `sin(x)` it does not make sense to substitute names, the programmer would usually know the name of the argument as they wrote the code. So the following is in fact sensible and a good choice for `R` (there is also the issue the variable and argument names are much more visible in `R` than in many other programming languages, so again one want to be careful with them).

``` r
substitute(sin(x = x), list(x = 7))
```

    ## sin(x = 7)

However `dplyr::mutate()` uses argument binding in "`...`" to denote assignments, so we would want control of both sides of such sub-expressions.

### `base::bquote()`

On August 15, 2003 Thomas Lumley contributed a fairly complete version of <code>Lisp</code>'s quasi-quotation (please see ["Quasiquotation in lisp", Alan Bawden, 1999](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.309.227)) system or ["the backquote"](http://cl-cookbook.sourceforge.net/macros.html) to `R` itself.

    commit 6af5ee3fab4a347accc61a96185921320547c1e6   refs/remotes/origin/R-grid
    Author: tlumley <tlumley@00db46b3-68df-0310-9c12-caf00c1e9a41>
    Date:   Fri Aug 15 18:46:06 2003 +0000

        add bquote for partial substitution
        
        
        git-svn-id: https://svn.r-project.org/R/trunk@25744 00db46b3-68df-0310-9c12-caf00c1e9a41

`R`'s syntax is different, so `R` uses the notation "<code>.(NAME)</code>" instead of "<code>\`NAME</code>", but the concepts are related to the back-tick or quasi-quotation ideas discussed in the Bawden paper.

`bquote()` has a fairly concise description (from `help(bquote)`):

> An analogue of the <code>Lisp</code> backquote macro. bquote quotes its argument except that terms wrapped in .() are evaluated in the specified where environment.

We can demonstrate the idea as follows. First we can use `bquote()` to quote a user supplied expression, preventing its execution.

``` r
x <- 7
A <- as.name("x")
bquote( A == 5 )
```

    ## A == 5

Now we can use the "`.()`" notation to turn off-quoting for portions of the expression.

``` r
bquote( .(A) == 5 )
```

    ## x == 5

And final we can execute the altered expression with `eval()`.

``` r
eval(bquote( .(A) == 5 ))
```

    ## [1] FALSE

We used the above pattern in our article ["R tip: How to Pass A formula to lm"](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/09/r-tip-how-to-pass-a-formula-to-lm/).

There is one limitation: due to `R`'s syntax rules `bquote()` style notation can not substitute on the left-hand side of an "`=`" expression. This means we can not use it to control the following sort of expression.

``` r
bquote( list(.(A) = 5) )
```

    ## Error: <text>:1:19: unexpected '='
    ## 1: bquote( list(.(A) =
    ##                       ^

`bquote` is given access to the un-evaluated expression, but only after it is parsed. And in this case the parse did not complete as the term "`.(A)`" was not considered an acceptable left-hand side for the "`=`". The problem is this sort of notation is used a lot for argument binding, and in the popular [`dplyr::mutate()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate.html) function (though there is a substitute notation "`:=`" available, a notation idea that the [<code>data.table</code>](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=data.table) package has used for quite some time.). One can work around the issue as we show below.

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))

NEWVAR <- as.name("y")
OLDVAR <- as.name("x")

eval(bquote(
  
  data.frame(x = 1) %>%
    mutate(.(NEWVAR) := .(OLDVAR) + 1)
  
))
```

    ##   x y
    ## 1 1 2

One can get (despite its unpopularity) "`=`"-style assignment working by introducing braces and a "false mutator" style function.

``` r
`.<-` <- function(x, value) {invisible(x)}
eval(bquote({ .(NEWVAR) = 17 }))
print(y)
```

    ## [1] 17

However, the rules for "`=`" as argument binding don't seem so easy to circumvent.

`bquote()` itself is another remarkable demonstration of the power of `R`'s substitute facility. The code for `bquote()` (accessible by executing `print(bquote)`) is amazingly compact. It is an example of where, with the right abstraction, an essentially 10-line function can do the job of an entire package. This is a common situation in functional programming languages; part of why design, criticism, and iteration are so important in functional programming. Also this compactness is fairly common when you stay out of the way of <code>eval</code>/<code>apply</code> and let them do the heavy lifting (as they are "Maxwell's Equations of Software": ["A conversation with Alan Kay", ACMqueue, Volume 2, Issue 9, December 27, 2004](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1039523), see also ["Lisp as the Maxwellâ€™s equations of software", Michael Nielson April 11, 2012](http://www.michaelnielsen.org/ddi/lisp-as-the-maxwells-equations-of-software/)).

### `gtools::strmacro()`

Gregory R. Warnes added `strmacro()` to the `gtools` package to supply an additional macro facility. The stated purpose of `strmacro()` is to accept argument names as quoted text. Let's demonstrate it below.

``` r
mul <- strmacro(A, B, expr={A*B})
x <- 7
y <- 2
mul("x", "y")
```

    ## [1] 14

Notice the macro arguments are can now be passed in as strings. This can be an advantage when the macro is going to be used by other `R` code such as a `for`-loop.

`strmacro` is can replace left-hand sides of argument bindings.

``` r
strmacro(A, expr = list(A = A))('"x"')
```

    ## $x
    ## [1] "x"

`strmacro` happens to be inconvenient for our particular application (executing a `dplry 0.5.0` pipeline) due to the need to explicitly execute the macro and the quoting. However, `strmacro` supplied good ideas for the initial implementation of `let()` (which has since evolved quite a bit) and we found studying it and the `defmacro()` to be very rewarding.

### An aside

At this point notice how generous Thomas Lumley has been to the `R` community. He took the time to teach macros, ported a variation of the concept into base-`R`, and then added variations of the macro facility to a public open-source package. This is the kind of non-empire building (for "empire" please see [Bill Venables, "<code>R</code>: *Quo Vaidis?*", *UseR! 2012*, Nashville, Tn, USA](http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/pub/Main/UseR-2012/VenablesRQuoVadis.pdf)) and giving back to the larger community that keeps `R` vital (another example is [Matt Dowle and Arun Srinivasan doing so much to improve sorting in base-`R`](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/08/timings-of-a-grouped-rank-filter-task/)).

### `lazyeval`

`dplyr 0.5.0`'s parametric programming interface was a package called [`lazyeval`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lazyeval) which describes itself as:

> An alternative approach to non-standard evaluation using formulas. Provides a full implementation of LISP style 'quasiquotation', making it easier to generate code with other code.

`lazyeval` does not seem to be currently recommended, and is not fundamentally more powerful than `base::bquote()`. The primary reason `bquote()` at one time did not seem like a good macro tool for working with `dplyr` is: `dplyr 0.5.0` did not include the `:=` operator. Once `:=` was added (part of `dplyr 0.7.0`'s `rlang` integration) `bquote()` was able to work seamlessly with `dplyr`.

The `:=` was the missing piece. A `dplyr` that allows `:=` to denote assignment (as `data.table` has for a very long time) does not need an extension package such as `lazyeval`, `wrapr`, or `rlang` as `base::quote()` can in such circumstances be made to work.

### `wrapr::let()`

For some code-rewriting tasks we found both `substitute()` and `bquote()` a bit limiting. For this reason we developed (taking inspiration from `gtools::strmacro()`) `wrapr::let()`. `wrapr::let()` was designed to have syntax similar to `substitute()` and to classic Lips let value-binding blocks (informal example: "<code>let X be 7 in expression(X)</code>").

Our first application of `let()` (at the time in the [`replyr`](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=replyr) package) was to perform parametric programming over `dplyr 0.5.0` (the version of `dplyr` current at the time).

We (me plus my college Dr. Nina Zumel) shared a number of articles and gave public talks on the topic.

-   [Using replyr::let to Parameterize dplyr Expressions](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/12/using-replyrlet-to-parameterize-dplyr-expressions/).
-   [help(let, package=â€™replyrâ€™)](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/12/helplet-packagereplyr/).
-   [My recent BARUG talk: Parametric Programming in R with replyr](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2017/02/my-recent-barug-talk-parametric-programming-in-r-with-replyr/).
-   [Does replyr::let work with data.table?](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2016/12/does-replyrlet-work-with-data-table/)
-   [Comparative examples using replyr::let](Comparative%20examples%20using%20replyr::let)
-   [Evolving R Tools and Practices](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2017/02/evolving-r-tools-and-practices/)

Other contributors worked out additional applications for `let()` including using it to control parameterized `R`-markdown.

We can work one of our `bquote()` section examples as follows.

``` r
library("wrapr")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))

NEWVAR <- as.name("y")
OLDVAR <- as.name("x")

let(c(NEWVAR = "y",
      OLDVAR = "x"),
    
  data.frame(x = 1) %>%
    mutate(NEWVAR = OLDVAR + 1)
  
)
```

    ##   x y
    ## 1 1 2

Notice `wrapr::let()` specifies substitution targets by name (not by any decorating notation such as backtick or `.()`), and also can use the original "="-notation without problem.

`let()` allows the user to [choose the substitution engine](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wrapr/vignettes/SubstitutionModes.html) and has debug-print option.

``` r
library("wrapr")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))

NEWVAR <- as.name("y")
OLDVAR <- as.name("x")

let(c(NEWVAR = "y",
      OLDVAR = "x"),
    eval = FALSE,
    
  data.frame(x = 1) %>%
    mutate(NEWVAR = OLDVAR + 1)
  
)
```

    ## data.frame(x = 1) %>% mutate(y = x + 1)

People who try `let()` tend to like it.

In our [formal writeup](https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr/blob/master/extras/wrapr_let.pdf) we take some time to point out other systems (Lumley, `gtools()`, `bquote()`, `lazyeval`, and even `rlang` even though it came *after* `let()`), and our debt to <code>gtools</code>:

> <code>strmacro()</code> was the inspiration for the original string-based <code>let()</code> implementation, although <code>let()</code> now uses the more powerful and safer language based method described above.

### `rlang:!!`

`rlang` was written by Lionel Henry and Hadley Wickham. `rlang` was incorporated into `dplyr` on June 6, 2017, giving it an incredible leg-up promotion and acceptance (with that platform, it doesn't have to compete on merits). For simple effects such as [our linear modeling example](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/09/r-tip-how-to-pass-a-formula-to-lm/) `rlang` can work with packages that it has not been integrated with. For the next example `rlang` can only be used with packages that have been re-built using `rlang` (such as `dplyr` has been).

`rlang` can be demonstrated on one of the examples we already exhibited in the `bquote()` section of this note as follows.

``` r
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("dplyr"))

NEWVAR <- as.name("y")
OLDVAR <- as.name("x")

  data.frame(x = 1) %>%
    mutate(!!NEWVAR := !!OLDVAR + 1)
```

    ##   x y
    ## 1 1 2

As with `bquote()` the `:=` notation is required. Substitution targets are marked with the "`!!`" notation. Notice how syntactically this differs from the `bquote()` solution only in tick-notation and not requiring an outer function (the benefit of `rlang` being integrated into the `dplyr` package). There are some semantic differences, such as how environments are handled. However, in our opinion, most of the earlier solutions already have sound ways of dealing with environments and ambiguity of references, which are merely different (not fundamentally inferior).

`rlang` also emphasizes the ability to capture environments along with expressions (not demonstrated here). We find users with the discipline to follow John M. Chambers' advice do not typically need this additional facility (some notes [here](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2018/08/r-tip-put-your-values-in-columns/)) and that collecting unexpected references to environments (as is often the case with `formula`, `closueres`, and now `quosures`) [is a source of reference leaks](http://www.win-vector.com/blog/2014/05/trimming-the-fat-from-glm-models-in-r/).

`rlang` documentation tends not to mention or credit earlier `R` work such as `defmacro()` or `let()`. It does sometimes mention `bquote()`, but never seems to actually *try* `bquote()` as an alternate solution in a post-`dplyr 0.5.0` world (i.e., one where "`:=`" is part of `dplyr`). So new readers can be forgiven for having the (false) impression that `rlang` substitution is a unique and unprecedented capability for `R`.

Conclusion
----------

`R` has a number of useful macro facilities. Not all `R` users know about them. This is because, due to a number of good `R` design decisions, not all `R` users regularly *need* macro facilities. If you do need to macros (or to "program over programs", which is always a bit harder than the more desirable programming over data) I suggest reading a few of the references and picking a system that works well for your tasks.

In particular `base::bquote()` is able to easily program over `dplyr 0.7.0` and later versions and is part of the core `R` language (or "base `R`", which *should* be a *huge* plus).

`rlang` is the method being promoted by the `dplyr` package authors, however we do not recommend it for general use.

As for our method (`wrapr::let()`). We feel `wrapr::let()` is sufficiently specialized (combining re-writing and execution into one function; restricted only to name for name substitutions) and sufficiently general (working with any package without pre-arrangement) that it is a good comprehensible, safe, convenient, and powerful choice for interested `R` users.
