This document describes `wrapr`, an [R](https://cran.r-project.org) package available from [Github](https://github.com/WinVector/wrapr) (via `devtools::install_github("WinVector/wrapr")`) and  [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org/) (via `install.packages("wrapr")`).


## Introduction

`wrapr` wraps `R` functions debugging and better standard evaluation.

Primary `wrapr` services include:

 * `wrapr::let()`
 * `wrapr::DebugFnW()`

 
## `wrapr::let()`

`wrapr::let()` allows execution of arbitrary code with substituted variable names (note this is subtly different than binding values for names as with `base::substitute()` or `base::with()`). 

The function is simple and powerful.  It treats strings as variable names and re-writes expressions as if you had used the denoted variables.  For example the following block of code is equivalent to having written "`a + a`".

```{r exw}
library("wrapr")

a <- 7

let(
  c(VAR = 'a'),
  
  VAR + VAR
)
```

This is useful it re-adapting non-standard evaluation interfaces (NSE interfaces) so one can script or program over them.

Please see `vignette('let', package='wrapr')` for more examples.

## `wrapr::DebugFnW()`

`wrapr::DebugFnW()` wraps a function for debugging.  If the function throws an exception the execution context (function arguments, function name, and more) is captured and stored for the user.  The function call can then be reconstituted, inspected and even re-run with a step-debugger.  Please see `vignette('DebugFnW', package='wrapr')` for examples.
